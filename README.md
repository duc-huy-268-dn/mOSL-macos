# macOS Lockdown (mOSL)
Bash script to audit and fix macOS security settings

- This script will **only ever** support macOS release  
- This script requires your **password** to invoke some commands with `sudo`  

This repository is fork from mOSL(https://github.com/0xmachos/mOSL) and Open-Audit(https://github.com/Opmantek/open-audit/blob/master/other/audit_osx.sh)

## `brew`

tap: [`est-rouge/er-homebrew-mosl`](https://bitbucket.org/est-rouge/er-homebrew-mosl)

To install mOSL via `brew` execute:

```
brew tap est-rouge/er-homebrew-mosl https://bitbucket.org/est-rouge/er-homebrew-mosl.git
brew install mosl
```

mOSL will then be available as:

```
Lockdown
```

## Threat Model(ish)

The main goal is to enforce already secure defaults and apply more strict non-default options.

It aims to reduce attack surface but it is pragmatic in this pursuit. The author utilises Bluetooth for services such as Handoff so it is left enabled.

There is **no specific focus** on enhancing privacy.

Finally, mOSL will not protect you from the [FSB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Security_Service), [MSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_State_Security_(China)), [DGSE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directorate-General_for_External_Security), or [FSM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flying_Spaghetti_Monster).
